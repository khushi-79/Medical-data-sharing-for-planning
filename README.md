# Medical data sharing for planning
 <h2>Hackathon project</h2>
<h2>Solution: EasyMedi Healthcare Portal</h2>
<p>Currently there are many patients admitted to government hospitals 
similarly there are several health-related interventions that are done by the 
municipality. However, these are mostly operations with very little visibility 
during running these schemes. People see data sharing at too risky because of 
privacy and security challenges. They maybe concern about losing control of 
their data. </p>
<p>In emergency time, patient need to reach hospital and collect medical data 
for further process. That time if we have a dataset of all these basic information 
of patient’s medical details then it is easy and faster to proceed further and we 
can save their life.</p>
<p>So for that we have come up with <b>Easy-Medi Healthcare Portal</b>. Having 
details of all hospitals according to area, details of doctor, patient’s personal 
data, patient’s medical data and dieses type and its medicines provided by 
doctor. These all data entered and extracted using their <b>Healthcard number</b>
having 12 digits unique number. This portal is provided to only doctors and 
hospital admins not to the general public.</p>
